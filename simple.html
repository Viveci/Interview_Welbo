    <h1>Hi team!</h1>
    <p>I have made this simple html file so I can include my .js solution somewhere
      </br>If you open the console, you test my algorithm.
      </br>As requested in the assignment, it is called <b>contains</b>, takes two inpus. 1: array of integers with the set rules(n*m), 2: lookup value. Returns true if value is found in the array.
      </br>I decided to use a binary search, since it is one of the fastest lookup algorythm in soreted arrays. In our case it is O(n*log(m)). It should be better than O(n+m) or O(n*m).
    </br>console.log(contains(dataset,3)); You can use your array and assert equal a few statments.
    </p>
    <p>You can find my presntation online in a goole slide in the link below. It might not be the most descriptive slides, but I would like to use it as an outline in the interview.</p>
